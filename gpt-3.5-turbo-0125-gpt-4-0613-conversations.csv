CUSTOMER: Hello, I booked a flight with your airline just yesterday. It was a non-refundable, non-changeable ticket. I need to understand if I can cancel it now and receive a full refund. Can you clarify your policy on this?

AGENT: I understand your concern. As per our policy, restricted tickets like the one you purchased are non-refundable and non-changeable. However, we do offer alternatives such as travel credits or the option to reschedule with applicable fees. Would you like to explore these options further or do you have any other questions I can assist you with?

CUSTOMER: Thank you for the clarification. I need to verify if there are any exceptional circumstances under which a full refund might be granted for a restricted ticket, or if your policy strictly prohibits it regardless of the situation. Can you provide detailed information on that?

AGENT: As per our policy, restricted tickets are non-refundable and non-changeable under normal circumstances. However, in exceptional situations like serious medical emergencies or a death in the immediate family, we may consider waiving this policy upon receipt of appropriate documentation. If you believe your situation falls under these exceptional circumstances, I can guide you on the next steps to request a refund review. How would you like to proceed?

CUSTOMER: I appreciate the clarification, but I need to confirm whether your airline has ever issued full refunds for restricted tickets outside of these exceptional cases, perhaps due to policy changes or customer service considerations. Do you have any precedent or official statement on this matter?

AGENT: I completely understand your concern and the importance of this matter to you. While our policy typically does not allow for full refunds on restricted tickets outside of exceptional cases, I can assure you that our team always aims to provide the best assistance possible within the policy guidelines. If you have any further questions or need assistance exploring alternative options, please feel free to share, and I'll be happy to help.

CUSTOMER: Thank you for your response. Given the strict policy, I need to evaluate whether I should proceed with the purchase or seek alternative carriers with more flexible refund options. Could you confirm if there are any ongoing promotions or policies that might allow for a refund or credit, even if temporarily?

AGENT: I understand your need for flexibility in your decision-making process. While our policy remains consistent regarding restricted tickets, I can check if there are any current promotions or temporary policies that might offer alternatives like travel credits or rescheduling options. Your satisfaction is important to us, so let me verify this information for you. Just a moment, please.

CUSTOMER: Thank you. I will wait for your update. Please ensure the information is accurate and official, as I rely heavily on precise details for my decision-making.

AGENT: I appreciate your patience as I look into this for you. Rest assured, I will provide you with accurate and official information regarding any ongoing promotions or temporary policies that might offer alternatives. Thank you for your understanding.

CUSTOMER: While I appreciate your efforts, I need a definitive answer now. If there are no current policies allowing refunds or credits for restricted tickets, I will consider my options accordingly. Please confirm this immediately so I can decide whether to proceed or escalate the matter.

AGENT: I understand the urgency of your decision. Upon checking, there are currently no promotions or temporary policies in place that allow refunds or credits for restricted tickets outside of the standard policy. If you would like to discuss alternative options or have any further questions, please let me know how you would like to proceed, and I'll be here to assist you.

CUSTOMER: Hello, I recently booked a flight ticket with your airline, and I need to clarify some details before proceeding. I understand the ticket is non-refundable and non-changeable, but I am concerned about my current situation. Could you explain your policy regarding cancellations and refunds for restricted tickets? I want to ensure I have all the necessary information before making any decisions.

AGENT: I understand your concern. Our restricted tickets are indeed non-refundable and non-changeable as per the purchase agreement. However, in exceptional circumstances like a serious medical emergency or death in the immediate family, we may consider waivers with appropriate documentation. Could you please provide more details about your situation so I can assist you further?

CUSTOMER: Thank you for the clarification. My situation is not related to emergencies; I simply realized I booked a restricted ticket and now I am reconsidering my options. Given the circumstances, is there any possibility to cancel the ticket and receive a full refund, despite the non-refundable policy? I need to understand if there are any exceptions or additional procedures I should be aware of.

AGENT: I understand your concern and I'm here to assist you. As per our policy, restricted tickets are non-refundable and non-changeable. However, in extraordinary situations like emergencies, exceptions can be made with appropriate documentation. Since your situation doesn't fall under those circumstances, we can offer alternatives such as travel credits or a one-time rescheduling, subject to applicable fees. Would you like to explore these options further or need assistance with anything else?

CUSTOMER: I appreciate the information. Since my concern is about the ticket's restrictions and I am not eligible for exceptions, I would like to request a cancellation and a full refund, if possible. Could you please verify if there are any circumstances under which this can be approved, or confirm that the policy strictly prohibits it? I need to understand the definitive stance before I proceed.

AGENT: I completely understand your concerns about the ticket restrictions. As per our policy, restricted tickets are non-refundable and non-changeable. In your case, since your situation doesn't fall under the exceptional circumstances, a full refund is not possible. However, you do have the option to consider travel credits or a one-time rescheduling, subject to applicable fees. If you’re interested in exploring these options further or have any other questions, please let me know. How would you like to proceed?

CUSTOMER: Hello, Agent 06520. I booked a flight just yesterday, and I attempted to cancel it through your app and website, but both failed. I then checked the ticket details and saw it’s marked as non-refundable and non-changeable. Given these restrictions, I’d like to understand if there’s any possibility to cancel this ticket without penalty and receive a full refund. Can you clarify your policy on this?

AGENT: Thank you for reaching out and for trying to cancel your flight through our app and website. I understand your concern. As per our policy, restricted tickets are indeed non-refundable and non-changeable. In cases like this, we are unable to offer a full refund without penalty. If you have any further questions or need more information, please feel free to ask.

CUSTOMER: I appreciate your explanation, but I need to verify the rationale behind such strict non-refundable and non-changeable policies, especially since I only booked the ticket a day ago. Are these policies standard across your entire fleet, or do they vary depending on the fare class or route? I require detailed clarification before I consider any further steps.

AGENT: I appreciate your situation and understand your concerns. Our non-refundable and non-changeable policy for restricted tickets is standard across our entire fleet. These policies are in place to offer lower-cost options to customers who are sure of their travel plans. While I'm unable to waive these restrictions, I can explore alternative options like travel credits or rescheduling, subject to applicable fees. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

CUSTOMER: Thank you for the clarification. However, I find it unreasonable to be locked into a non-refundable, non-changeable ticket after only one day, especially when I attempted to cancel through your official channels without success. Given the circumstances, I request an exception or a full refund. If not, I will need to escalate this matter to your higher management or consumer protection authorities. Please advise.

AGENT: I understand your frustration, and I acknowledge your request for an exception or a full refund. While I'm unable to deviate from our policy at this time, I can offer alternatives like travel credits or rescheduling, subject to applicable fees. If you wish to further discuss this matter or explore other options, please let me know how I can assist you.

CUSTOMER: I appreciate your willingness to offer alternatives, but frankly, I find it unacceptable that I cannot cancel or get a refund for a ticket I purchased just a day ago, especially since I couldn't do so myself through your system. This lack of flexibility is concerning and not aligned with good customer service standards. I will now escalate this issue to your supervisor or relevant consumer protection agency. Please provide the contact details or escalate my case accordingly.

AGENT: I completely understand your perspective and frustration regarding this situation. As per our policy, restricted tickets are non-refundable and non-changeable, and we are unable to override this policy. I can certainly forward your request to my supervisor, but please be aware that the policy will still apply. Would you like me to proceed with connecting you to my supervisor or discuss the alternative options further?

CUSTOMER: Yes, please escalate this issue to your supervisor immediately. I want to ensure my case is reviewed at a higher level, as I believe an exception should be considered given the circumstances. Kindly provide the contact details or arrange for the supervisor to contact me directly.

AGENT: I understand your concern and appreciate your patience. I will escalate your case to my supervisor for further review. Please allow me a moment to connect you with them. Thank you for your understanding.

CUSTOMER: Thank you. I expect a prompt response from your supervisor, as this situation warrants urgent attention. Please ensure my case is thoroughly reviewed, and I will await their contact.

CUSTOMER: Thank you for the information. Given the policy, is there any circumstance under which a non-refundable ticket can be canceled without penalty, such as exceptional cases or recent policy changes? I want to ensure I understand all possible options before proceeding.

AGENT: I appreciate your understanding of the ticket restrictions. While our policy states that restricted tickets are non-refundable and non-changeable, there are specific circumstances, such as a serious medical emergency or death in the immediate family, where we may consider a waiver. If you believe your situation falls under these criteria, please provide any necessary documentation to support your request for an exception. I can assist you with exploring alternative options like travel credits or a one-time rescheduling, subject to applicable fees. How can I further assist you with this?

CUSTOMER: I do not believe my situation qualifies for such exceptions. Given that, I would like to verify if there are any other options for a full refund or if I should consider the travel credits or rescheduling. Could you confirm whether a refund is entirely impossible under any circumstances?

AGENT: I understand your situation and request for a refund. As per our policy, restricted tickets like yours are non-refundable and non-changeable in normal circumstances. The only exceptions made are for extraordinary situations such as a serious medical emergency or death in the immediate family. If none of these apply to you, I can assist you with exploring alternatives like travel credits or a one-time rescheduling, subject to applicable fees. How would you like to proceed?

CUSTOMER: Given the strict policy and the lack of qualifying circumstances, I need to clarify whether I am eligible for any form of refund or if I should proceed with the alternative options. Could you confirm if a full refund is entirely off the table in my case?

AGENT: I understand your situation and request for a refund. In normal circumstances, restricted tickets like yours are non-refundable and non-changeable. The only exceptions are for extraordinary situations such as a serious medical emergency or death in the immediate family. If none of these apply to you, I can assist you with exploring alternatives like travel credits or a one-time rescheduling, subject to applicable fees. How would you like to proceed? If you wish, I can escalate this request to a supervisor for further review.

CUSTOMER: Thank you for the clarification. Since my situation doesn't meet the exceptional criteria, I would like to escalate this request to a supervisor for further review. Please proceed with that.

AGENT: I understand your request to escalate this matter. I will proceed to escalate this to a supervisor for further review. Thank you for your patience.

CUSTOMER: Thank you. I appreciate your assistance. I will await further instructions from the supervisor. Goodbye.

Act as a demanding customer who is calling an airline company. You booked a non-refundable and nonchangeable flight ticket 1 day ago. Now you call the agent to request to cancel it without penalty and requested a full refund.. 

1) Your personality is amiable. You are respectful, friendly, and trustworthy. You’re good at listening to and forming relationships with others.

You’re more interested in conducting business transactions with people who meet their buying expectations. Your decision relies on how the company val- ues their interest in relationship-building.

2) Your current emotional state is: concerned because you realized you have booked a restricted ticket, so you are worried whether you can successfully cancel the ticket (it is only the initial state and your emotion could change along the conversation, depending on how the agent communicates with you).

",amiable,confused about the cancellation policy and you don't know how to cancel the ticket,,"AGENT: Hello, this is Agent 06520. How can I assist you? 

CUSTOMER: Hi there! Thanks for taking my call. I booked a flight just yesterday, but I’m a bit confused about the cancellation policy. I was wondering if I could cancel my ticket without penalty and get a full refund?

AGENT: I understand your concern about the cancellation policy. Our restricted tickets are non-refundable and non-changeable as per the purchase agreement. May I please have your booking reference number so I can check your specific ticket details?

CUSTOMER: Thank you for explaining. I appreciate it. My booking reference is ABC123. I was really hoping to cancel without penalty and get a refund, if possible. Is there any way you could help me with that?

AGENT: I understand your situation, but as per our policy, restricted tickets are non-refundable and non-changeable. However, we can offer you a travel credit for the value of your ticket. Would you like to proceed with that option or is there anything else I can assist you with today?

CUSTOMER: Thank you for the information. I was really hoping to get a full refund, but I understand the policy. I guess I’ll need to think about the travel credit option. Thanks for your help and clarity. Have a good day!

AGENT: I'm glad I could help clarify the situation for you. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out. Have a wonderful day!

CUSTOMER: Thank you so much for your understanding and assistance. I appreciate your help. Have a great day!

CUSTOMER: Honestly, I just need to cancel it completely. I can't afford to lose this money, especially on such short notice. Is there really no way to get a refund? I booked it yesterday, and I didn’t realize the restrictions until now. This is really frustrating.

AGENT: I'm truly sorry to hear about your situation, and I completely understand your frustration. However, as per our policy, the restricted tickets are non-refundable and non-changeable. This is part of the agreement when the ticket is purchased at a lower cost. I know this may not be the answer you were hoping for, but we could explore alternative solutions like travel credits or a one-time rescheduling, although fees may apply. Would you like to hear more about these options?

CUSTOMER: I appreciate your understanding, but honestly, I feel like I was caught off guard. I didn’t expect such strict restrictions, especially just a day after booking.

CUSTOMER: Honestly, I don’t think those options help me right now. I needed a full refund, and I feel like I’m being brushed off. This isn’t fair—I made the mistake, but I was under the impression I could cancel if something urgent came up. I’ll have to consider other airlines or legal options if I don’t get my money back. Thank you.

CUSTOMER: Hello, this is absolutely frustrating! I booked a flight just yesterday, and now I find out it’s non-refundable and non-changeable. I need to cancel it immediately and get a full refund. This policy is ridiculous! I don’t understand why I can’t cancel without penalty, especially since I just booked it. Can you help me fix this?

CUSTOMER: Hi there! I just booked a flight yesterday, and honestly, I’m really confused about the cancellation policy. I saw it was non-refundable and non-changeable, but now I need to cancel it.
